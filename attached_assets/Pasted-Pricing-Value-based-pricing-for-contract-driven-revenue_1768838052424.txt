Pricing
Value-based pricing for contract-driven revenue
LicenseIQ is priced based on the financial complexity and revenue under management, not per user, document, or transaction.
Our pricing reflects the value we deliver: accuracy, control, audit-ready execution, and reduced revenue leakage.

Pricing tiers
Control
Designed for finance teams replacing spreadsheets with deterministic, contract-driven execution.
Typically includes:
Contract ingestion and clause-to-rule execution
Support for one core contract flow
(e.g., distributor rebates, royalties, or chargebacks)
Transaction or POS data ingestion
Deterministic calculations and accrual outputs
ERP-ready journal entry outputs
Clause-to-journal traceability
Finance-owned review and approval controls
Best for:
Mid-market organizations establishing financial control over a high-impact contract flow.

Support for multiple contract flows
Advanced validation and eligibility rules
Period-over-period consistency controls
