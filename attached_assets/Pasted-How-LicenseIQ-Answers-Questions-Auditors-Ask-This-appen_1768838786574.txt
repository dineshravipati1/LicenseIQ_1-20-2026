How LicenseIQ Answers - Questions Auditors Ask
This appendix reflects real questions auditors ask during revenue, accrual, and channel program audits — especially where contracts, estimates, and partner data are involved.

1. How do you determine the correct amount to accrue?
What auditors want to know:
Is the accrual calculated using consistent, documented logic tied to contractual obligations?
How LicenseIQ supports this:
Accruals are derived directly from contract-defined rules, not spreadsheets
Each accrual is traceable to:
The source contract
The specific clause or rate
The underlying transaction or reported data
Calculations are deterministic and reproducible

2. What evidence supports these calculations?
What auditors want to know:
Can Finance reproduce the numbers independently and explain the logic?
How LicenseIQ supports this:
Every calculation produces a full evidence package, including:
Contract clause references
Input data used
Applied rates, tiers, and thresholds
Calculation steps
Outputs are consistent across periods unless the contract or data changes

3. How do you validate third-party or partner-reported data?
What auditors want to know:
Are partner reports trusted blindly, or validated against contract rules?
How LicenseIQ supports this:
Partner and licensee data is validated against contract eligibility rules
Exceptions are flagged and documented
Finance can demonstrate:
What was accepted
What was rejected
Why

4. How do you prevent or detect revenue leakage?
What auditors want to know:
Are there controls to detect under-reporting, over-claims, or pricing violations?
How LicenseIQ supports this:
Rule-based validation combined with variance detection
Historical trend comparisons
Threshold-based exception flags
Documented follow-up and resolution paths

5. How do you ensure consistency period over period?
What auditors want to know:
Are accruals and settlements calculated consistently across closes?
How LicenseIQ supports this:
Contract logic is versioned and locked per period
Any contract change automatically creates a new effective version
Period-over-period differences are explainable and traceable

6. Who reviews and approves the calculations?
What auditors want to know:
Is there a documented review and approval process?
How LicenseIQ supports this:
Configurable review checkpoints
Clear ownership between:
Contract interpretation
Data validation
Final posting approval
Audit logs show who reviewed, approved, and when

7. How do you handle disputes or restatements?
What auditors want to know:
Are disputes handled systematically and documented?
How LicenseIQ supports this:
Disputes are tied to:
The original contract
The affected data and calculation
Adjustments create clear reversal and rebooking entries
Full historical trail is preserved

8. How do you ensure management judgment is applied appropriately?
What auditors want to know:
Where does judgment exist, and how is it controlled?
How LicenseIQ supports this:
Judgment points are explicit and documented
Overrides require justification and approval
All overrides are fully auditable and traceable

9. How do these calculations integrate into the general ledger?
What auditors want to know:
Are postings controlled, accurate, and reconciled?
How LicenseIQ supports this:
Produces ERP-ready journal entries
Supports reconciliation between:
Sub-ledger calculations
GL balances
Clear mapping between calculation outputs and posted entries

10. How quickly can you respond to audit questions?
What auditors want to know:
Can Finance respond without manual reconstruction?
How LicenseIQ supports this:
Evidence is available on demand
No spreadsheet rebuilding or ad-hoc explanations
Audit questions are answered using the same system used to calculate the numbers
Optional closing line (recommended)
LicenseIQ doesn’t just calculate the numbers — it explains them.
