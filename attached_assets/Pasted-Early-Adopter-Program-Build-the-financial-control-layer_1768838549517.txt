Early Adopter Program
Build the financial control layer for contract-driven revenue
LicenseIQ is inviting a limited number of early adopter customers to partner with us as we define a new standard for contract-to-cash financial control.
This program is designed for finance teams managing channel programs, licensing, royalties, and incentive agreements who want end-to-end traceability from signed contracts to ERP journal entries.

Who this program is for
The Early Adopter Program is a strong fit if you:
Operate on a NetSuite-era or mid-market ERP
Manage distributor, reseller, licensing, royalty, or incentive contracts
Rely on signed agreements and spreadsheets to calculate accruals or settlements
Face recurring challenges during close, audits, or partner disputes
Want Finance to own contract execution and financial truth
This program is intentionally finance-led, not sales- or pricing-driven.

Supported contract-to-cash flows
Early adopters can deploy LicenseIQ for one or more of the following flows:
Channel & Partner Programs
Distributor and reseller rebates
Sell-in and sell-through incentives
POS and transaction validation
Accruals and settlement calculations
Price protection and chargebacks
Licensing & Royalties
Sales-based and usage-based royalties
Tiered rates, minimum guarantees, and caps
Licensee reporting validation
Multi-currency calculations
Royalty accruals, settlements, and statements
All flows use the same execution engine and provide full traceability from contract clause to journal entry.

What early adopters get
Early adopters receive:
Production access to LicenseIQ for scoped contract flows
Guided onboarding with direct access to the founding team
Contract-to-journal traceability configured using real contracts and data
Priority influence on product roadmap and execution patterns
Early access to audit, variance, and dispute-resolution capabilities

Commercial terms (transparent, not promotional)
Early adopters benefit from:
Founding-customer pricing (below future list pricing)
Discounted or credited implementation fees
Multi-year price protection
Flexible scope during the initial deployment
Pricing is based on revenue under management and contract complexity, not per user or per document.

What we ask in return
Because this is a partnership program, we ask early adopters to:
Commit to an initial production deployment
Provide structured feedback during onboarding
Participate in a reference or case study once value is proven (timing agreed mutually)
This ensures the program remains focused, collaborative, and high-signal.

Why we’re doing this
Most mid-market companies still execute channel and licensing contracts using spreadsheets layered on top of signed documents and ERPs.
LicenseIQ exists to replace that with:
Deterministic, contract-driven execution
Finance-owned control and accountability
Audit-ready proof
Built-in conflict resolution
Early adopters help shape this category — and benefit first.

Early Adopter Program – FAQ
For Finance & Accounting Leaders

Is this a beta or pilot product?
No. LicenseIQ is deployed in production environments as a financial execution and control layer.
The Early Adopter Program is about partnership and scope, not product maturity.
Early adopters receive priority onboarding and influence over roadmap sequencing, but deployments are production-grade from day one.

What problem does LicenseIQ actually solve for Finance?
LicenseIQ gives Finance end-to-end traceability from a signed contract to ERP journal entries.
Specifically, it:
Converts contract clauses into executable financial logic
Validates real transaction data against those contracts
Calculates accruals and settlements deterministically
Produces audit-ready journal outputs with full lineage
This replaces spreadsheet-driven interpretation with finance-owned execution and proof.

How is this different from our ERP, pricing tools, or incentive systems?
Most systems handle parts of the process:
ERPs book results
Pricing tools optimize prices
Incentive tools manage payouts
LicenseIQ sits between contracts and the books.
It ensures the numbers Finance posts are correct, explainable, and defensible — regardless of which upstream systems you use.

Do we need to replace any existing systems?
No.
LicenseIQ:
Does not replace your ERP
Does not set prices or approve deals
Does not require ripping out existing tools
It integrates with your current environment and produces ERP-ready outputs while your ERP remains the system of record.

What contract flows can we start with?
Early adopters typically start with one or two high-impact flows, such as:
Distributor or reseller rebates
Price protection or chargebacks
Licensing and royalties
Additional flows can be added over time using the same execution engine.

How long does implementation take?
Typical timelines:
4–6 weeks for a focused initial deployment
Depends on contract complexity, data readiness, and number of flows
Implementation ensures Finance signs off on:
Contract logic
Data validation
Accrual and settlement outputs
before go-live.

Why is there an implementation fee?
Implementation de-risks the deployment for Finance.
It covers:
Contract normalization and rule validation
Data mapping and reconciliation
ERP output verification
A close-cycle dry run
Early adopters may receive discounted or credited implementation fees, but the work itself is essential to ensure trust in the numbers.

How is pricing determined?
Pricing is based on:
Revenue under management
Contract and data complexity
Number of flows in scope
It is not based on:
Number of users
Number of documents
Usage or compute
Most early adopters see 5–10× ROI through leakage reduction, close efficiency, and audit risk reduction.

Is LicenseIQ SOC / audit ready?
LicenseIQ is designed for audit defensibility, including:
Clause-to-journal traceability
Reproducible calculations
Clear evidence packages for auditors
Formal certifications can be discussed as part of enterprise rollout planning.

What does “early adopter” mean in practice?
Early adopters:
Get priority access to the founding team
Influence roadmap sequencing
Receive favorable commercial terms
Shape how the category evolves
It is a design partnership, not a trial program.

What do you expect from early adopters in return?
We ask early adopters to:
Commit to a production deployment
Provide structured feedback during onboarding
Participate in a reference or case study once value is proven (timing agreed mutually)
This keeps the program focused and high-signal.

What happens after the early adopter phase?
Early adopters:
Retain their pricing protections
Expand scope at agreed commercial terms
Transition seamlessly into standard support and governance models
There is no forced re-platforming or re-implementation.

How do we know if we’re a good fit?
You’re likely a strong fit if:
Finance relies on spreadsheets to execute contract-driven revenue
Accruals or settlements require explanation every close
Audits or disputes create recurring friction
You want Finance — not Sales Ops — to own financial truth
If that sounds familiar, the Early Adopter Program is designed for you.

How do we apply?

All applications are reviewed to ensure:
Mutual fit
Clear value opportunity
Focused scope for a successful deployment

Optional closing line (recommended)
LicenseIQ is built for finance leaders who want certainty, not just automation.
