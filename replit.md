# Overview

License IQ Research Platform is a SaaS web application for intelligent contract management and analysis. It automates contract processing, risk assessment, and compliance using AI, offering features like automated payment calculations, dynamic rule engines, and a RAG-powered Q&A system. The platform aims to reduce manual effort, provide actionable insights, and ensure revenue assurance for industries with complex licensing agreements through an "AI-Native" architecture.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**Terminology Standards:**
- Use "License Fee" (NOT "Royalty") throughout the application
- Use "liQ AI" (NOT "Contract Q&A") for the RAG-powered assistant - Note: lowercase 'l', lowercase 'i', uppercase 'Q'

# System Architecture

## UI/UX Decisions
The platform features a modern, responsive UI built with React, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui, incorporating animated gradients, sticky navigation, and a comprehensive menu. It includes an omnipresent AI assistant via a floating button. Design elements are inspired by DualEntry.com, support dark mode, and offer interactive charts for analytics. The application supports a multi-theme system with 12 unique color schemes. Consistent USA date formatting (MM/DD/YYYY) is applied across the platform.

## Technical Implementations
The frontend utilizes React, TypeScript, Vite, Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for state management, and React Hook Form with Zod for validation. The backend is an Express.js and TypeScript RESTful API with a layered service architecture. PostgreSQL, with Drizzle ORM and pgvector, serves as the primary database. File storage uses Multer. A dynamic contract processing system employs a knowledge graph database schema for AI-powered zero-shot extraction and human-in-the-loop validation. Performance is optimized with consolidated AI extraction calls, defensive numeric validation, enhanced JSON recovery from AI responses, flexible territory matching, safe date parsing, and updated HuggingFace API endpoints. Sales data upload supports flexible CSV column name variations with intelligent field normalization. Multi-location context switching is implemented for dynamic organizational context management, impacting navigation and permissions. Navigation management includes categorized, collapsible menus with user-customizable drag-and-drop reordering, persisted in the database.

- **Categorized Navigation System**: Intelligent database-driven menu organization with collapsible categories, user-customizable preferences, and persistent expand/collapse state per user.
- **Multi-Location Data Filtering**: Comprehensive hierarchical access control enforcing organizational context across ALL data tables (contracts, sales, calculations) with admin bypass, preventing cross-context data leakage.
- **Two-Tier Admin System**: System Admin (super user managing all companies) and Company Admin (managing only their own company) with database-driven permissions.
- **ERP Integration Hub**: Centralized interface for managing versioned field mappings and data imports with full 3-level hierarchy access control (company/BU/location), dry-run previews, version history with revert capability, and approval workflows.
- **Pre-Import Data Filtering**: Industry-standard filter builder for import sources supporting dynamic criteria (equals, contains, greater than, between, etc.) for text, number, date, and boolean fields with AND/OR logic, filter preview endpoint for testing before import, and filter statistics in import job metadata.
- **Dual Terminology Mapping**: ERP-aware contract extraction that maps contract terms to ERP fields using AI with confidence scores. Workflow: AI extracts entities → AI auto-maps to ERP vocabulary → User confirms/modifies mappings via UI → Rules display both contract terms and ERP field names (e.g., "Net Revenue (ERP: GROSS_SALES)"). Pending mappings stored in pending_term_mappings table with auto-confirmation for high-confidence matches.
- **ERP Mapping Rules System**: Parallel automated license fee calculation system operating alongside manual rules. Features organization-level calculation approach toggle (Manual/ERP Rules/Hybrid), ERP Mapping Rule Sets management with CRUD operations, field mapping configurations, and full audit trail via execution logs. Supports gradual adoption with per-contract overrides.
- **Rule Source Indicators**: Visual badges showing rule origin (AI Extracted vs Manual) with tooltips displaying confidence scores and contract sections for AI-extracted rules. Source inferred from existing metadata (sourceText, sourceSection, confidence fields).
- **Multi-Dimensional Calculation Reports**: After running license fee calculations, results can be viewed in multiple dimensions dynamically based on ERP field mappings. Includes Summary, Detail, Vendor-wise, Item-wise, Item Class-wise, Territory-wise, and Period-wise views. Dimensions are auto-generated from confirmed ERP mappings per contract. Features tabbed interface with aggregation, percentage breakdown, and PDF export functionality.
- **Per-Table Rule Extraction**: Enhanced AI extraction that detects and processes each pricing table separately to prevent cross-contamination between different pricing tiers. Uses regex-based table detection (markdown tables, tier headers) and sends focused prompts to AI for each table independently. Includes hallucination detection that identifies when the AI copies threshold values from one tier to another and automatically corrects them.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Rule Confirmation**: Confidence-based rule review system where high-confidence rules (>=85%) are auto-confirmed and lower-confidence rules require human review. UI shows review status badges (Needs Review/Confirmed/Auto) and provides a "Confirm Rule" button for pending rules. Review status, reviewer, and timestamp are tracked in the database for audit purposes.
- **Multi-Level Settings System**: Comprehensive hierarchical configuration management with three levels:
  - **System Settings** (Super Admin): AI model configuration (model selection, temperature, max tokens, retries), confidence thresholds for auto-confirmation, security settings (session timeout, login attempts, MFA, audit logging), feature flags (AI extraction, RAG Q&A, ERP integration, multi-location), and customizable AI prompt templates.
  - **Company Settings** (Company Admin): Localization (date format, timezone, currency), contract type management (5 predefined + custom types), approval workflows, branding (colors, logo), and default calculation approach.
  - **Contract Types**: 8 system-defined types (Direct Sales, Distributor/Reseller, Referral, Royalty/License, Rebate/MDF, Chargebacks/Claims, Marketplace/Platforms, Usage/Service Based) plus custom types per company.
- **Contract Type-Specific AI Prompts**: Customizable prompt templates per contract type for optimized AI extraction. Each contract type has 4 configurable prompts (extraction, rule extraction, ERP mapping, sample output) editable in System Settings. Default prompts stored in `server/prompts/defaultContractTypePrompts.ts` are seeded to database on startup. Prompts are applied across all extraction paths (consolidated, chunked, per-table) with fallback chain: database → defaults → generic.

## System Design Choices
The architecture emphasizes an AI-native design, integrating AI capabilities throughout. It prioritizes asynchronous AI processing with free APIs and uses a relational data model for core entities. The platform is designed for enterprise readiness, supporting multi-entity operations, user management, audit trails, and flexible data import. The system includes robust multi-location context filtering and a two-tier admin system for granular access control. Server startup seeding ensures consistent data across environments.
